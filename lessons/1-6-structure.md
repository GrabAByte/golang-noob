## Package Structure: GoLang

* package main lets the Go compiler know that we want this code to compile and run as a standalone program, as opposed to being a library that's imported by other programs.
* import "fmt" imports the fmt (formatting) package from the standard library. It allows us to use fmt.Println to print to the console.
* func main() defines the main function, the entry point for a Go program.
